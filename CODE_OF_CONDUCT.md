# Code of Conduct

LF Decentralized Trust (LFDT) is a collaborative project hosted by The Linux Foundation. It is an open-source, open community project where participants choose to work together and, in that process, experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which LFDT will not tolerate.

A Code of Conduct (CoC) is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization. This CoC applies to any member of the LFDT community—developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

## Statement of Intent

LFDT is committed to maintaining a positive working environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where participants at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.

## Code

- Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
- Never harass or bully anyone verbally, physically, or sexually.
- Never discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
- Communicate constructively and avoid demeaning or insulting behavior or language.
- Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and acknowledge properly the contributions of others.
- Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.
- Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.
- With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional, unfair, or unwelcome behavior or advances.
- Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
- Stay on topic: make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people.
- Step down considerately: members of every project come and go, and LFDT is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.

## Glossary

- **Demeaning Behavior** is acting in a way that reduces another person's dignity, sense of self-worth, or respect within the community.
- **Discrimination** is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on criteria such as: physical appearance, race, ethnic origin, genetic differences, national or social origin, name, religion, gender, sexual orientation, family or health situation, pregnancy, disability, age, education, wealth, domicile, political view, morals, employment, or union activity.
- **Insulting Behavior** is treating another person with scorn or disrespect.
- **Acknowledgement** is a record of the origin(s) and author(s) of a contribution.
- **Harassment** is any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
- **Leadership Position** includes group Chairs, project maintainers, staff members, and Board members.
- **Participant** includes developers, member representatives, staff members, and anyone from the public partaking in the LFDT work environment (e.g., contribute code, comment on our code or specs, email us, attend our conferences, functions, etc.).
- **Respect** is the genuine consideration you have for someone (if only because of their status as participant in LFDT, like yourself), and that you show by treating them in a polite and kind way.
- **Sexual Harassment** includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault.
- **Unwelcome Behavior** can be difficult to define. Some questions to ask yourself are: how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient? Would my spouse, parent, child, sibling, or friend like to be treated this way? Would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization's newsletter? Could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group? Could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing? Would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that? Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don't do it.
- **Unwelcome Sexual Advance** includes requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, where submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment.
- **Workplace Bullying** is a tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behavior (e.g., verbal or written abuse, offensive conduct, or any interference which undermines or impedes work) against a co-worker or any professional relations.
- **Work Environment** is the set of all available means of collaboration, including, but not limited to, messages to mailing lists, private correspondence, web pages, chat channels, phone and video teleconferences, and any kind of face-to-face meetings or discussions.

## Incident Procedure

To report incidents or to appeal reports of incidents, send email to Mike Dolan ([mdolan@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:mdolan@linuxfoundation.org)) or Angela Brown ([angela@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:angela@linuxfoundation.org)). Please include any available relevant information, including links to any publicly accessible material relating to the matter. Every effort will be taken to ensure a safe and collegial environment in which to collaborate on matters relating to the project. In order to protect the community, the project reserves the right to take appropriate action, potentially including the removal of an individual from any and all participation in the project. The project will work towards an equitable resolution in the event of a misunderstanding.
