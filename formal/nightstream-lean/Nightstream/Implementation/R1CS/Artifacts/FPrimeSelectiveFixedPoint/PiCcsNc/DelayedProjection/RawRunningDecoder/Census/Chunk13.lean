/-!
Executable certificate for generated raw-running decoder shard 13.

The `native_decide` input is exactly 252 proof-free `AllocationRecord`s with
five `Nat` fields and one `Encoding` tag each, five scalar metadata values,
and a `Fin 252` traversal.
No other shard or proof-bearing structure is traversed.

Owns: the exact executable certificate for generated shard 13, containing
exactly 252 proof-free `AllocationRecord`s.

Does not own: any other shard, global record flattening, assignment semantics,
R1CS satisfaction, protocol acceptance, transcript scheduling, or commitment
authority.

Emits constraints: none; proof-only bounded certificate.
