# K=2 Π_CCS Test Fixtures

This directory contains pre-computed test fixtures for k=2 folding tests.

## Fixture Sets

### k2_honest (Basic k=2 fold)
- Computation 1: 2 + 3 = 5
- Computation 2: 7 + 11 = 18
- Tests basic k=2 folding: 1 MCS + 1 ME → 2 ME outputs

### k2_ivc (IVC simulation)
- Step 0: 1 + 1 = 2 (folded to ME)
- Step 1: 5 + 7 = 12 (folded with Step 0's ME)
- Tests IVC-like usage where prior state is folded with new computation

## Usage

These fixtures are loaded dynamically by the test code in `06_integration_pi_ccs_k2_smoke.rs`.
The fixtures are re-created by the helper functions in that file since the cryptographic
types (Commitment, MeInstance) cannot be easily serialized/deserialized.

## Generation

Generated by: `cargo test --package neo-fold --test core fixture_gen::generate_k2_fixtures -- --ignored --nocapture`
